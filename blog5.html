                <!-- Introduction -->
                <section>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Market sizing is an essential process for understanding the scope and potential of a business within its target market. For ADOPTABLE, this involves analyzing the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) to determine growth opportunities in the pet adoption sector. This article breaks down these concepts and discusses their practical applications to guide ADOPTABLE’s strategy.

                    <h3>Defining Market Sizing: TAM, SAM, and SOM</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Understanding market sizing is crucial for gauging the potential reach of ADOPTABLE. Below are the definitions of the three critical market sizing metrics:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                        <li><strong>Total Addressable Market (TAM):</strong> This represents the total revenue opportunity available in the pet adoption industry if ADOPTABLE were to capture 100% of the market. It includes the number of pets in need of adoption and the entire pool of potential adopters across regions and countries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serviceable Available Market (SAM):</strong> This is the portion of TAM that is within ADOPTABLE's serviceable capabilities. It reflects the geographical regions and specific demographics where ADOPTABLE can effectively operate, such as urban areas in the Philippines where adoption resources are more concentrated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):</strong> This is the practical share of SAM that ADOPTABLE can capture in the near term, taking into account factors like brand strength, marketing efforts, competition, and available resources. It’s the portion of the market that ADOPTABLE aims to acquire in the short and medium term.</li>
                    </ul>
