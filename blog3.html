                        <p><strong>What is a Revenue Model?</strong></p>
                        <p>A revenue model is the framework that a company uses to generate income. It represents the methods, strategies, and structures that a business adopts to monetize its offerings, turning its products or services into a consistent revenue stream. A well-defined revenue model is crucial because it lays out the process for earning money, ensuring financial sustainability and growth. For a startup like Adoptable, this model helps balance user engagement with profitability while aligning with our mission to simplify the pet adoption process.</p>

                                <div class="circular-image">

                                <h3>Fee for Service</h3>
                                <p>Our Fee for Service model offers two distinct options to users depending on the type of adoption: For users choosing free adoptions, we charge a fixed service fee of ₱200 to ensure the sustainability of our platform. For those engaging in paid adoptions, we collect a 20% commission on the adoption fee. This dual-approach allows us to generate revenue while offering flexibility to adopters. Additionally, recognizing that frequent users might find ads distracting, we provide a premium experience that removes ads for a small fee of ₱50 for 24 hours, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted browsing experience.</p>

                                <h3>Donation-Based Model</h3>
                                <p>Adoptable also embraces a donation-based revenue model, accepting both monetary and in-kind donations from individuals, businesses, and organizations. These donations go directly toward supporting the operational costs of the platform, funding adoption events, and enhancing pet welfare initiatives. This model allows us to stay aligned with our mission of supporting rescue organizations while maintaining affordability and accessibility for users. By leveraging the goodwill of our community and partners, we can keep the platform running smoothly without burdening adopters with high fees.</p>

                                <h3>Partner Sponsorship</h3>
                                <p>In addition to donations, Adoptable engages in a Partner Sponsorship model. We collaborate with sponsors who provide financial support or in-kind contributions. In exchange for their support, sponsors receive valuable brand exposure on our platform and during various adoption events. This model helps strengthen relationships with key stakeholders, including businesses and corporations that align with our mission, while simultaneously providing them with marketing opportunities within a targeted, animal-loving community.</p>

                                <h3>In-App Advertising</h3>
                                <p>To further diversify our revenue streams, Adoptable generates income through in-app advertising. This model allows third-party advertisers to display their ads within our app, creating a passive source of revenue. The ads come in various forms, such as Banner Ads, which are placed at the bottom of the screen, providing a non-intrusive way to engage users. Interstitial Ads appear at strategic points during the user journey, offering a full-screen experience after a transaction, while Native Ads blend seamlessly into the app’s content, ensuring they feel integrated and natural to the user experience.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why These Models?</strong></p>
                        <p>We strategically selected these revenue models because they align with our goal of maintaining financial stability while ensuring that Adoptable remains accessible to as many adopters as possible. By diversifying our income sources, we can reduce dependence on any single stream, making our platform more sustainable in the long term. Moreover, each model allows us to offer value to different stakeholders, whether they are users, donors, or sponsors, while keeping our services affordable and impactful for animal rescue organizations. This comprehensive approach ensures that Adoptable will continue to thrive, enabling us to improve pet welfare and streamline the adoption process for years to come.</p>
